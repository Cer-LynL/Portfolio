              My journey into the world of web development began during my time at Tallinn University of Technology, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology. From the start, I found myself drawn to the fascinating realm of web technologies, and as a result, I became well-versed in HTML and CSS. Additionally, in my current job, I have had the opportunity to utilize JavaScript to craft responsive navigation menus and other simple yet impactful elements. As my passion for web development grew, I delved into React through engaging tutorial projects, further expanding my skillset.

              Beyond the realm of work and academia, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. Cooking, nurturing plants, and staying active with a particular enthusiasm for boxing are among my favorite pastimes. Not to mention, my lovely cat Tiara is a constant source of warmth and comfort in my life. Furthermore, I share a deep appreciation for the captivating worlds of Marvel, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and other enthralling sci-fi/fantasy stories. And let's not forget the allure of travelingâ€”nothing excites me more than exploring diverse cultures, immersing myself in the beauty of nature, and marveling at the sights of far-off lands.
